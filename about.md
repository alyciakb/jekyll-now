I'm Alycia and I'm currently a Data Science student at the University of British Columbia. I graduated from the University of Idaho with a business degree three years ago and worked in marketing and recruiting for a real estate brokerage prior to starting the MDS program at UBC. I also train and compete as an elite track and field athlete, representing Canada at the 2017 World Championships in Athletics. My goal is to represent Canada once again in 2019 at the World Championships - this time as a newly minted Data Scientist.

### More Information

Check back as I will be developing and posting content for this blog throughout my MDS program.
