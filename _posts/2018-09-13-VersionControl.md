title: VERSION CONTROL
---

If you are anything like me, you have a nasty habit of having files open and being edited in multiple places. If I'm doing this locally, I might have a "draft" version and a "final" version of a file. But then I find myself STILL editing BOTH versions of the document. Obviously the "final" version isn't so final. It makes for headaches later on as I look at the two versions and try to pick out the differences between the files to decide which version is better.

In class we've learned about version control and merge conflicts with GitHub and it has already been an incredibly useful lesson for me. On numerous occassions this week, I have made changes locally to a file on my computer and made changes to the same file directly on GitHub. When I try to push my local changes up to GitHub, I'm met with a merge error. Fortunately, we've learned about how to handle merge errors and GitHub provides me with a single file that clearly shows the differences between the versions, so I can easily keep the better changes while discarding the others. Hopefully one day I will learn my lesson and edit my files in only one location, but until then, I'm happy there's systems in place that keep me from breaking my own work.
