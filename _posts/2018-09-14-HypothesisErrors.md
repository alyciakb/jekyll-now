<h3><p style="text-align:center;">A look at the differences between false positives and false negatives</p></h3>

It's 7am and John and Sally are staring at a timer: *3-2-1 ding ding ding*, the timer goes off. They nervously glance at each other and then pick up the pregnancy test, it's positive. They begin celebrating, they've been trying to have a baby for years! They call the doctor's office to set up a formal appointment and while at the appointment, Sally and John find out they are NOT pregnant. The test was wrong. They've been the victims of a false positive test.

But what if John and Sally picked up the pregnancy test and it was negative? What if the test told Sally she was NOT pregnant and a couple months later she found out the test was incorrect and surprise! She is now a few months pregnant? In that case, Sally and John would be the victims of a false negative test.


### **What's the difference between a false positive and a false negative?**

**A false positive is also called a Type I error.** It occurs in hypothesis testing when you "reject the null hypothesis for your alternative hypothesis".

* A **null hypothesis** is the assumption that nothing has changed, *i.e. Sally is NOT pregnant*.
* The **alternative hypothesis** is that something has changed, *i.e. Sally IS pregnant*.

If you "reject the null hypothesis" then you are saying that YES something has changed and the alternative hypothesis is true. If you are incorrect, then you have committed a Type I error (a false positive): You have said that something has changed when it has not changed. You've said that Sally is pregnant, when it turns out that she isn't.

**A false negative, on the other hand, is called a Type II error.** It occurs when you accept the null hypothesis but you should have rejected it. It's the same as saying that Sally is NOT pregnant (nothing has changed) when in reality she IS pregnant (something has changed).


### **But why do we care about the difference between them?**

*In both cases a mistake has been made, why does it matter what type of mistake it is?*


Let's look at another example. What do you think is worse:

1. A doctor tells a patient that they have cancer, but it turns out the patient does NOT have cancer.
2. A doctor tells a patient they are cancer-free, but in reality they do have cancer.

*Yikes.* Both situations would not be fun to be in, but scenario #2 is arguably much worse. A patient believes they are cancer-free and go about their days without seeking treatment, all the while the cancer is growing. Whereas in scenario #1, a patient is scared because they think they have cancer, but upon further testing they will find out that they don't have cancer - *phew, crisis averted!*

In this situation, scenario #2 is a false negative and it is more serious to commit this type of error.

**This is why the type of error matters.** When you are doing hypothesis testing you can control how certain you need to be in your testing before you accept that something has changed (reject the null hypothesis). For something like cancer, you want your doctor to be VERY certain that you do NOT have cancer before they tell you that you don't. In this situation, doctors can set up their initial tests so it is easier to reject the null hypothesis, meaning it is easier to say "hmmm, you might have cancer, more testing needs to be done".

In other situations, you might want to make it more difficult to reject the null hypothesis. This is the case in the judicial system. We've all heard the saying "innocent until proven guilty". In terms of hypothesis testing, we have:

* **Null Hypothesis:** Innocent/Not Guilty
* **Alternative Hypothesis:** Guilty

The judicial system has decided that it is worse put an innocent person behind bars (false positive) than it is to let a guilty person walk free (false negative). This is why, in a criminal case, a guilty verdict can only occur if the jury unanimously agrees that someone is guilty "beyond a reasonable doubt". The courts do this to try to prevent a false positive from occuring and to prevent sending an innocent person to jail.

As you can see there are important distinctions between a false positive and a false negative. Which one is a worse error depends on the situation. When you are doing the hypothesis testing, you can look at which error type is worse and plan for it. You can decide how much certainty your testing needs in order to accept or reject the null hypothesis, and doing this can help decrease the chance of getting either a false positive or a false negative.
