<h3><p style="text-align:center;">Using Data Analysis to Decide Whether or Not to Keep My Car Insured While at UBC Vancouver</p></h3>


My big question when moving to Vancouver for school is should I keep my car insured? It's common knowledge in BC that it is expensive to own a car in Vancouver and that the alternative transportation options in, public transit and car share, are fantastic. Plus, I have a nice commuting bike and some (limited) carpool options.

The decision sounds easy, ditch the car! But for me, it's not that simple. I'm also a competitive runner and I train with a team based out of the Langley area. This means that ~3 times per week I meet up with them to run outside Vancouver. These are longer commutes and harder to get to via transit, so now the decision takes more thought.

Let's look at the three factors most important to me:

1.  **Cost.** I am a student currently, so I have expenses but no income. I want to minimize my transportation costs.

2.  **Time.** Between school and running, I have a demanding schedule and want to minimize commute time.

3.  **Convenience.** I want to be able to go where I want, when I want and have flexibility in my options.


Let's dive into each individually:

### Price


**Car Cost:**

1.  Insurance - $125 (pleasure use only, maximum discounts).
2.  Gas cost - $8.25 per roundtrip.
3.  Maintenance - $180/year (3 oil changes per year at $60 each)

**Transit Cost:** Due to mandatory UBC transit enrolment, I will say this fee is $0.

**Car Share Cost:** I researched Modo, Car2Go, Zipcar, and Evo, and found Modo to be the best option for me. It would cost $30-45 per round trip, so it is too expensive to use for every commute, but can use it occassionally, about 3 times per month.

**Carpool Cost:** My teammate drives to practice regardless, so I would simply pay her half the cost of gas - $4.12 per rountrip.

Graphing the overall monthly car costs and combined alternative transportation (carpool, transit, and car share) costs:

### Time

Next we'll look at commute times for weekend morning and weekday evening practices.

*A couple things to note:*

1.  For simplicity, "Car" driving time will apply to both my own car and car share.
2.  The carpool time is based on transit time to teammate's apartment + drive time to run locations from there.
3.  There are no transit options to Surrey Bend or Derby Reach.

### Convenience

This is a more subjective category, but I've given +1 or -1 to the travel types depending on whether it's convenient or inconvenient.

Departure Time:

* +1: Car - can leave any time
* -1: Transit - Must follow bus schedule
* -1: Carpool - Must follow bus schedule and teammate's schedule
* +1: Car share - can leave any time

Arrival proximity to location:

* +1: Car - can park close
* -1: Transit - may have to walk
* +1: Carpool - can park close
* +1: Car Share - can park close

Simplicity:

* +1: Car - access in front of house and take it the whole way to practice
* -1: Transit - must change busses on every route
* -1: Carpool - must change busses and go to teammate's car
* -1: Car Share - must locate and get to car before I can use it

Other Factors:

* +1: Transit - bus stop close to my house
* +1: Transit - less effected by rush hour than driving
* -1: Transit - unable to take to some locations
* -1: Carpool - depend on teammate's availability
* -1: Car Share - must return car to "home area"
* -1: Car Share - must specify return time in advance

**Scores:**
* Car = +3
* Alternative Transportation = -5

--------------------------------------------


Now looking at the price, time, and convenience factors together:


<center><img src="/images/lab4_blogpost_files/figure-markdown_github/table1.png" alt="Table 1" /></center>

*Keeping my car is an additional $70 per month and has positive convenience. The bus is an additional 2 hours commuting per month and has negative convenience.*

If I turn all factors into dollars:

* Time will be valued at my past wage, $25 per hour.
* 1 convenience point = $1 per week savings ($4 per month)


The table becomes:

The total is based on an "added cost" factor, so the lower the score the better. With this calculation, my car reigns supreme (barely).

*Now, let's quickly address the limitations of this analysis: I only considered using the transportation methods to get to practices, not for errands, meet ups, etc. I did not factor in any of the environmental benefits of carpooling and transit. The convenience score is arbitrary and different scoring methods could result in a different decision. ALL of my costs and times are estimates and reality may vary.*

That being said, the analysis did slightly favour me keeping my car insured this year and that is what I plan to do!
