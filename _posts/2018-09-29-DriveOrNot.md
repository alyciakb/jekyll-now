<h3><p style="text-align:center;">Using Data Analysis to Decide Whether or Not to Keep My Car Insured While at UBC Vancouver</p></h3>


To drive or not to drive. That was my big question when moving to Vancouver for school. It's common knowledge in BC that it is expensive to own a car in Vancouver (high insurance rates plus high current gas prices) and that the alternative transportation options in Vancouver -public transit and car share- are fantastic. Plus, I have a nice commuting bike and some (limited) carpool options.

It sounds like a no brainer, just ditch the car! But for me, it's not that simple. I'm also a competitive runner and I train with a team based out of the Langley-Maple Grove area. This means that ~3 times per week I meet up with them to run in trail systems in the suburb cities outside Vancouver. These are longer commutes and harder to get to via transit. Now the decision is more complex, do I keep my car insured this year or do I take off insurance and rely on alternative transportation?

Let's look at the three factors that are most important to me:

1.  **Cost.** This is one of the major decision factors. I don't have an income currently, but I do have a lot of expenses with school and living. I want to minimize my transportation costs.

2.  **Time.** This is huge. Between school and running, I have a very demanding schedule and would like to minimize the amount of time I spend commuting.

3.  **Convenience.** I want to be able to go where I want, when I want and I want it to be relatively easy to get where I want to go. In other words, I want flexibility.

### Price

There are many factors to consider for the cost of the different transportations. Here's what I factored in:

**Car Cost:**

1.  Insurance estimation - $125 (pleasure use only, maximum discounts).
2.  Gas usage/cost estimation - $8.25 per roundtrip.
3.  Parking - $0 because the parks we run at have free parking.
4.  Maintenance - hoping for no major maintenance, but will need oil changes. At $60 each and 3 per year, it is a yearly cost of $180.

**Transit Cost:** Due to a mandatory enrolment in the UBC Compass Card program, it is a university fee I can't avoid. Thus I will call my transit costs $0.

**Car Share Cost:** I researched Modo, Car2Go, Zipcar, and Evo, and found Modo to be the most cost-effective and available option for my needs. It would cost $30-45 per round trip. It would cost $400-500 per month if I used it every time. This is infeasable, so it would need to be used as an emergency option, when carpooling and transit are not available. I estimate that I will need to use it on 3 occassions per month when transit or carpool options are not available.

**Carpool Cost:** My teammate drives to practice regardless, so if I were to carpool with her I would simply pay her half the cost of gas - $4.12 per rountrip.

### Time

Below you can see the graphs of my approximate weekend commute times based on practice being in the morning and weekday commute times based on driving during after-work rush hour.

*A couple things to note:* 1. For the purpose of keeping my calculations a bit easier, "driving time" will apply to both my own car and car share. I'm going to ignore the time it takes to get to a car share and address that when I talk about Convenience and Flexibility. 2. The carpool time is based on the time to transit to my teammate's apartment plus the time it takes from there to the running destination via car. 3. There are no transit options to Surrey Bend or Derby Reach.
