## Using data science to determine whether I should keep my car insured while at UBC in Vancouver

To drive or not to drive. That was my big question when moving to Vancouver for school. It's common knowledge in BC that it is expensive to own a car in Vancouver (high insurance rates plus high current gas prices) and that the  alternative transportation options in Vancouver -public transit and car share- are fantastic. Plus, I have a nice commuting bike and some (limited) carpool options.

It sounds like a no brainer, just ditch the car! But for me, it's not that simple. I'm also a competitive runner and I train with a team based out of the Langley-Maple Grove area. This means that ~3 times per week I meet up with them to run in trail systems in the suburbs outside Vancouver. These are longer commutes and harder to get to via transit. Now the decision is more complex, do I keep my car insured this year or do I rely on alternative transportation?

Let's look at the three factors that are most important to me:

1. **Cost.** I am a student currently, so I have a lot of expenses and no income. I want to minimize my transportation costs.

2. **Time.** Between school and running, I have a very demanding schedule and would like to minimize time spent commuting.

3. **Convenience.** I want to be able to go where I want, when I want and have flexibility in my options.

Now, let's look into these three factors:

### Price

Here's what I factored in for transportation cost:

**Car Cost:**

  1. Insurance estimation - \$125 (pleasure use only, maximum discounts).
  2. Gas usage/cost estimation - \$8.25 per roundtrip.
  3. Parking  - \$0 because the parks we run at have free parking.
  4. Maintenance - hoping for no major maintenance, but will need oil changes. At \$60 each and 3 per year, it is a yearly cost of \$180.

**Transit Cost:**
Due to a mandatory enrolment in the UBC Compass Card program, it is a university fee I can't avoid. Thus I will call my transit costs \$0.

**Car Share Cost:**
I researched Modo, Car2Go, Zipcar, and Evo, and found Modo to be the most cost-effective and available option for my needs. It would cost \$30-45 per round trip, which is \$400-500 per month if I used it every commute. This is infeasable, but it can be an emergency option, when carpooling and transit are not available. I estimate I will use it on 3 occassions per month.

**Carpool Cost:**
My teammate drives to practice regardless, so if I were to carpool with her I would pay her half the cost of gas - $4.12 per rountrip.

```{r price, echo=FALSE}
carinsurance <- 125
ave_gas <- 8.25
car <- carinsurance + ave_gas*3*4 + 180/12
transit <- 0
modo <- 40
car_share <- modo * 3
carpool <- ave_gas*3*4/2

transportation <- c("Personal Car", " Combined Carpool/Car Share")
barplot(c(car, carpool + transit + car_share), beside=TRUE, main="Monthly Cost for Transportation", 
        xlab="Transportation Type", ylab="Monthly Cost", ylim=c(0,250), col=c("skyblue", "orange"),
        names.arg=(transportation), legend = rownames(transportation))
```

### Time

Next we'll look at commute times for weekend morning and weekday evening practices.

*A couple things to note:*

1. For simplicity, "Car" driving time will apply to both my own car and car share. I am ignoring the time it takes to get to a car share vehicle and will address it when I talk about Convenience.
2. The carpool time is based on transit time to teammate's apartment + drive time to run locations from there.
3. There are no transit options to Surrey Bend or Derby Reach.

```{r time, echo=FALSE}
# List of common running locations that I need to commute to.
destinations <- c("Surrey Bend", "Langley", "Burnaby Lake", "SFU", "Derby Reach")
type <- c("Personal Car", "Carpool", "Transit")
graphcols <- c("skyblue", "violet", "forestgreen")

# Bar plot of weekend morning estimated commute times to those locations via driving vs. transit
barplot(matrix(c(55,45+25,0,55,45+40,155,35,45+10,78,45,45+15,84,50,45+35,0), nr=3), beside=TRUE, main="WeekEND Commute Time by Car vs. Transit", 
        xlab="Running Destinations", ylab="Commute Time (minutes)", ylim=c(0,200), col=graphcols, names.arg=(destinations),
        legend = rownames(destinations))
legend("topright", type, fill = graphcols, cex=0.7)

# Bar plot of weekday evening estimated commute times to those locations via driving vs. transit
barplot(matrix(c(70,45+35,0,70,45+60,175,60,45+20,80,60,45+25,90,85,45+50,0), nr=3), beside=TRUE, main="WeekDAY Commute Time by Car vs. Transit", 
        xlab="Running Destinations", ylab="Commute Time (minutes)", ylim=c(0,200), col=graphcols, names.arg=(destinations),
        legend = rownames(destinations))
legend("topright", c(type), fill = graphcols, cex=0.7)
```

### Convenience

This is a more subjective category, but I will apply a convenience score to the options. I've labeled everything as (C) convenient, (I) inconvenient, or (N) neutral. (C) = 5 points, (N) = 0 points, and (I) = -5 points.

**Car:**

  - \(C) Can depart at any time
  - \(C) Easy parking in front of my house
  - \(C) Easy and close parking to our run locations

**Transit:**

  - \(C) Bus stop is a less than 1min walk from my house.
  - \(I) Only 1 bus option where I live and need to connect to other busses or the skytrain for all routes.
  - \(C) Busses/transit less effected by rush hour and traffic.
  - \(N) Bus comes every 10min on weekday afternoon/evenings.
  - \(I) Bus comes every 20min on weekend mornings.
  - \(I) Infeasible to take transit to most run locations.
  - \(N) Feasible to take transit to Burnaby Lake or Mountain with 1-2 bus/train changes
  - \(N) Feasible to take transit to teammate's apartment to carpool with 1-2 bus/train changes
  - \(I) Some walking involved to get to run locations

**Carpool:**

  - \(N) Rely on teammate's schedule
  - \(I) May only be available to carpool on certain days
  - \(C) Easy and close parking to run locations

**Carshare:**

  - \(I) Need to bus or walk to the car share vehicles (usually about 8 blocks away)
  - \(C) Can set up rental for any time and time period
  - \(I) Must return car by rental end time
  - \(N) Must return car to "home area"
  - \(C) Easy and close parking to run locations

**Car is awarded 15 points and other transportation has a combined -10 points for convenience.**


Adding it all together (per month): 

| FACTOR | CAR |  OTHER TRANSPORT |
|---|---|---|
| PRICE: | +\$70 | Neutral |
| TIME: | Neutral | +2 hours |
| CONVENIENCE SCORE: | 15 | -10 |

If I turn all factors into dollars:

- Time will be valued at my past wage, \$25 per hour.
- 1 convenience point = -\$1 (saving me $1).
- Neutral = \$0

The table becomes:

| FACTOR | CAR |  OTHER TRANSPORT |
|---|---|---|
| PRICE: | 70 | 0 |
| TIME: | 0 | 50 |
| CONVENIENCE SCORE: | -15 | 10 |
| **TOTAL SCORE:** | **55** | **60** |



The total is based on a cost factor, so the lower the score the better. Which means, with this calculation, my car reigns supreme (barely). I should keep it insured to drive it to practice. However with a difference factor of only "$5 per month", either decision would be acceptable.

Of course we need to briefly talk about the limitations of this analysis: I only factored in using the transportation methods to get to practices, I did not factor in errands, meet ups, vacations, other travel. The convenience score is arbitrary and different scoring methods could result in a different decision. ALL of my costs and times are estimates. I cannot fully predict how long it will take on a given day to get somewhere nor exactly how much gas will cost.

All in all, the analysis favours me keeping my car insured and driveable this year and that is what I plan to do.
